React Component with Life-Cycle methods
---------------------------
-> Component Object Created -> constructor() -> state initialization
-> Component is rendered -> render() -> design + state display
-> Component is Loaded in DOM -> componentDidMount() -> for SERVER API Calls
-> Component is Updated -> componentWillUpdate() -> to update the state for every condition
-> Component is Removed from DOM -> componentWillUnmount() -> for clear the state information


JavaScript -> DOM <script> -> end of <body>
