1. Parent should have a function to receive the data from child

    receiveData = (data:string):void => {
        this.setState({
            ...this.state,
            cMessage : data
        });
    };

2. configure this parent function "receiveData" to child with props

	<ChildComp sendData={this.receiveData}/>

3. inside the child component, call the "Prop" and send Data

   this.props.sendData(this.state.cText);
